This repository contains the source code of RFNet, using following dataset:

Emotion Recoginition: 

[SEED:](https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/~seed/seed.html) 15 subjects participated experiments with videos as emotion stimuli (positive/negative/neutral) and EEG was recorded with 62 channels.

[SEED-VIG:](https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/~seed/seed-vig.html): Vigilance estimation using EEG data in a simulated driving task. 23 subjects participated experiments and 17 EEG channels were recorded.
